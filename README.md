What's your ETA is a web application that returns a live feed for the NYC subway and bus system by using the MTA API.

How it works:
Search by a specific train or bus to get a list of all their stops and their next arriving vehicles. Add a station to your favorites list to keep track of it on the front page or use the 'Nearby Stations' button to retrieve stops that are close to you.

Feeds are updated every minute. 

How to run locally on your computer:
Use `node app.js` in the default folder to run the server for the API and use `npm run dev` in the src folder to run the web application.
